# BuildingPlayfulWorlds3
Project for my school, Building Playful Worlds.

Pretty much just a family-friendly drug-making simulator with some fancy random stuff in there that undoubtedly makes no sense at all.
(I do not condone the usage of drugs nor do I use them or whatnot just don't do drugs maybe if you're in a controlled environment just be careful if you do take drugs but personally I just wouldn't recommend it)
